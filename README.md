# 2048 Replica
**You can view the live version [here](http://charliegdev.github.io/2048_replica/).**

This is my own replica of the popular game [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).
It is written in HTML, CSS, Javascript (ECMA 6) and jQuery. I wrote all code (except jQuery library) from the ground up.

The project is not entirely finished yet, but you can view the source code here, and click the link
above to see the work in progress.

Because of ECMA 6's compatibility issues, currently the game does not support Safari. This may be fixed in the future; but
for now, please view the game using Chrome, Firefox or IE.

## Progress
- UI (mostly) 
- Tile Spawning
- Tile movement
- Collision detection 
- Tile merge algorithm
- Display Correct Numbers in Tiles
- Github page

## Goals
- [ ] Score
- [ ] Mobile Page

## Issues
- [ ] Might redo interface with Bootstrap
- [ ] Zooming in/out the page will leave gaps between tile and board grid
- [ ] The current way of tile movement utilize marginTop/marginLeft, that might be improved

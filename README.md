# 2048 Replica
This is my own replica of the popular game [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).
I have written all the source code from the ground up (not including jQuery library, of course).
The project is not done yet, but you can view the source code here!

## Progress
- UI (mostly) 
- Tile Spawning
- Tile movement
- Collision detection 
- Tile merge algorithm
- Display Correct Numbers in Tiles

## Goals
- [ ] Score
- [ ] Github page

## Issues
- [ ] Might redo interface with Bootstrap
- [ ] Zooming in/out the page will leave gaps between tile and board grid
- [ ] The current way of tile movement utilize marginTop/marginLeft, that might be improved
